inputs:
  token:
    description: >-
      Personal access token (PAT) used to query the latest PMD release via
      api.github.com and to determine the modified files of a push/pull request
      (see option "analyzeModifiedFilesOnly").

      By default the automatic token for GitHub Actions is used.

      If this action is used in GHES environment (e.g. the baseUrl is not
      "api.github.com"), then the token is only used for querying the modified
      files of a push/pull request. The token won't be used to query the latest
      PMD release.

  version:
    description: >-
      PMD version to use. Using "latest" automatically downloads the latest
      version.

      Available versions: <https://github.com/pmd/pmd/releases>

      Note: Only PMD 6.31.0 and later is supported due to required support for
      [Sarif report
      format](https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_userdocs_report_formats.html#sarif).
    required: false
    default: latest
  downloadUrl:
    description: >-
      Manually specify the download URL from where the PMD binary distribution
      will be downloaded. By default, this parameter is empty and the download
      URL is automatically determined by querying the PMD releases at
      <https://github.com/pmd/pmd/releases>.

      This can be used to test PMD versions that are not official releases.

      If a downloadUrl is specified, then the version must not be "latest". You
      need to specify a concrete version. The downloaded PMD won't be cached and
      will always be downloaded again.

  analyzeModifiedFilesOnly:
    description: >-
      Instead of analyze all files under "sourcePath", only the files that have
      been touched in a pull request or push will be analyzed. This makes the
      analysis faster and helps especially bigger projects which gradually want
      to introduce PMD. This helps in enforcing that no new code violation is
      introduced.

      Depending on the analyzed language, the results might be less accurate
      results. At the moment, this is not a problem, as PMD mostly analyzes each
      file individually, but that might change in the future.

      If the change is very big, not all files might be analyzed. Currently the
      maximum number of modified files is 300.

      Note: When using PMD as a code scanner in order to create "Code scanning
      alerts" on GitHub, all files should be analyzed in order to produce a
      complete picture of the project. Otherwise alerts might get closed too
      soon.
    required: false
    default: 'true'
  createGitHubAnnotations:
    description: >-
      By default, all detected violations are added as annotations to the pull 
      request. You can disable this by setting FALSE. This can be useful if you 
      are using another tool for this purpose.
    required: false
    default: 'true'
  uploadSarifReport:
    description: >-
      By default, the generated SARIF report will be uploaded as an artifact
      named "PMD Report". This can be disabled, e.g. if there are multiple
      executions on multiple os of this action.
